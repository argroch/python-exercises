"""
Create a Python program that acts as a employee record tracker.

There will be a class called "Employee". With at least these attributes:

name
role (or occupation)
location
Let's assume our company has multiple locations. For an extra method, create one that transfers the employee to another location.

The program will allow the user to create a new employee record, view and modify an existing record.
